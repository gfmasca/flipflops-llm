# FLIPFLOPS

This is a personal project for my brother to use as a study helper. I plan to implement a LLM fine tuned with his school data that can be a personal teacher for whatever task he wants.

## Roadmap

1. Build the LLM using RAG methodology
2. Implement a very basic frontend inspired in chatGPT
3. Build a simple relational database to store the school data for my brother

## Stacks I plan to use

1. Python for the LLM model using Flask to create endpoints to feed the frontend
2. Nextjs on the frontend
3. MySQL to the database
4. Node if necessary for the backend
